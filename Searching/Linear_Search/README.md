# Linear Search in Java

A simple Java program that demonstrates the **Linear Search** algorithm using user input.  
The program searches for a target element in an array and returns its position if found.

## 🧠 Concept Used

- Linear Search algorithm  
- Arrays in Java  
- User input using `Scanner`  
- Conditional statements  
- Iterative traversal

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters the size of the array.
2. The user inputs array elements.
3. A target element is entered.
4. The program scans the array **sequentially**.
5. If the element is found, its position is returned.
6. If not found, `-1` is returned.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Works for **unsorted arrays**
- Best suited for **small datasets**
- Inefficient for large arrays compared to binary search
